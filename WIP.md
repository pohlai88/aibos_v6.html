# WIP: Modular Icon System for AI-BOS Modules

## Vision
- Each module in AI-BOS will have its own unique, beautiful icon/logo, inspired by iCloud/macOS style (rounded, colorful, minimal, professional).
- Icons will be SVG-based for scalability and easy integration as React components.
- This supports both a unified SaaS and modular/light SaaS deployments.

## Why Modular Icons?
- Visual distinction for each module
- Intuitive navigation and branding
- Supports multi-industry, multi-tenant, and white-label use cases
- Future-proof: easy to add new modules and icons

## Icon Design Principles
- Rounded corners, soft backgrounds, and modern color palette
- Minimal, clear shapes (no clutter)
- Consistent line weight and sizing
- Looks great on both light and dark backgrounds

## Example Modules (First Batch)
1. Procurement
2. Quality Certification
3. Business Permit & Licensing
4. Sales / CRM
5. Inventory
6. Warehouse
7. Internal Audit
8. HRM
9. Payroll
10. Learning & Development
11. Business Intelligence & Analytics
12. Metadata Management

...and more (see full list in previous planning)
