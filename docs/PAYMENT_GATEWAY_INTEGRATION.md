# Payment Gateway Integration (Stub)

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for integrating payment gateways to automate subscription billing for the AIBOS accounting SaaS platform.

## Supported Gateways (Planned)
- Stripe
- PayPal
- Local bank FPX (for Malaysia)

## Key Features
- **Automated Billing:** Recurring subscription charges.
- **Webhooks:** Handle payment success/failure notifications.
- **Invoice Generation:** Auto-generate and email invoices.
- **Customer Self-Service:** Users can update payment methods and view billing history.

## Example Integration Stub (Stripe)
```python
import stripe

stripe.api_key = "sk_test_..."

# Create a customer
customer = stripe.Customer.create(email="user@example.com")

# Create a subscription
subscription = stripe.Subscription.create(
    customer=customer.id,
    items=[{"price": "price_123"}],
)
```

## Next Steps
- Add payment method management endpoints.
- Implement webhook handlers for payment events.
- Link subscription status to access control.
