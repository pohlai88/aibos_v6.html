# Alignment Rules: UI, Supabase, and Business Logic (Enhanced)

## Purpose

To ensure every feature/page in this project is fully aligned between the frontend (UI), backend (Supabase), and business logic, with comprehensive security, performance, testing, and documentation practices.

---

## Alignment Process (To Be Followed for Every Feature/Page)

### 1. **Page-by-Page Walkthrough**

- Review each page/feature individually
- For new features, follow this process before merging
- Assign risk category (ðŸ”´ Critical, ðŸŸ¡ Medium, ðŸŸ¢ Low) to each feature

### 2. **UI & Supabase Data Alignment**

- Ensure all UI data requirements are mapped to Supabase tables/columns
- Confirm all Supabase data is correctly surfaced in the UI
- Document data transformations between UI and database formats
- Verify data types match between frontend and backend

### 3. **Security & Authorization Alignment**

- âœ… Confirm UI permissions match Supabase RLS policies exactly
- âœ… Verify users only see data they're authorized to access
- âœ… Test authorization at UI, API, and database levels
- âœ… Document permission matrices for each user role
- âœ… Ensure sensitive data is never exposed in client-side code
- âœ… Validate session handling and token refresh mechanisms

### 4. **Supabase Migrations**

- For any new or changed data, create/update migration files in `/supabase/migrations/`
- Migrations must be reviewed, tested, and reversible
- Test both up and down migrations in development
- Document migration dependencies and rollback procedures

### 5. **Multi-layer Validation Strategy**

- âœ… **Client-side validation**: Immediate UX feedback, input formatting
- âœ… **Server-side validation**: Security validation (never trust client)
- âœ… **Database constraints**: Final safety net with proper constraints
- âœ… **Consistent validation rules**: Same rules across all layers
- âœ… **Error message consistency**: Uniform error messaging throughout

### 6. **Error Handling Alignment**

- âœ… Define how UI handles Supabase errors (network, validation, auth failures)
- âœ… Document error states and user feedback mechanisms
- âœ… Implement graceful degradation for offline/network issues
- âœ… Plan error recovery workflows for users
- âœ… Set up error logging and monitoring

### 7. **Real-time Data Sync (if applicable)**

- âœ… Document real-time subscription handling and cleanup
- âœ… Define optimistic update strategies with rollback mechanisms
- âœ… Plan for concurrent user scenarios and conflict resolution
- âœ… Handle stale data and cache invalidation properly
- âœ… Test real-time behavior under various network conditions

### 8. **Performance Alignment**

- âœ… Document caching strategies for each feature
- âœ… Ensure efficient database queries match UI data needs
- âœ… Plan pagination/infinite scroll consistently
- âœ… Monitor query performance and data loading times
- âœ… Optimize for mobile and slow network conditions
- âœ… Set performance benchmarks and monitoring

### 9. **Testing Requirements**

- âœ… **Unit tests**: Business logic validation and calculations
- âœ… **Integration tests**: UI-Supabase interactions and data flow
- âœ… **End-to-end tests**: Complete user workflows
- âœ… **RLS policy testing**: Security policy validation
- âœ… **Performance regression tests**: Critical user flow performance
- âœ… **Error scenario testing**: Network failures, invalid data, auth issues

### 10. **CRUD Mapping Documentation**

- For each UI action (Create, Read, Update, Delete):
  - Specify what data is sent to Supabase
  - List the exact table(s) and column(s) affected
  - Document how the UI should handle responses (success, error, loading)
  - Include data validation rules and constraints
  - Document any data transformations or calculations

### 11. **Data Flow Mapping**

- For each page/feature, document:
  - Which columns/tables are used to pull data from Supabase
  - How data flows from Supabase to UI and back
  - Complete user workflow from start to finish
  - Include diagrams or step-by-step descriptions
  - Document any caching or state management

### 12. **Monitoring & Observability**

- âœ… Define success metrics for each feature
- âœ… Plan error tracking and alerting thresholds
- âœ… Document performance benchmarks
- âœ… Set up user behavior tracking (if applicable)
- âœ… Monitor database query performance
- âœ… Track user journey completion rates

### 13. **Documentation Updates**

- Update `README.md` and/or relevant docs with all mappings
- Cross-reference this file in the README and PR templates
- Update API contracts, database schema docs, and business rules
- Include troubleshooting guides for common issues
