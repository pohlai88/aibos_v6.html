# 🏛️ Core vs. Module

Define:
- What is "core" (platform-wide logic, security, auth, entity/user context, navigation)
- What is a "module" (business domain: CRM, finance, HRM, etc.)
- API boundaries and allowed interactions
- Rules for module onboarding, updating, or disabling

<!-- Replace this with your core/module separation details. -->
