# ✅ How MFRS and KPMG Intelligent Solutions Work Together in SaaS

MFRS → is the **compliance standard** — sets the rules for how to recognize, measure, present, and disclose financial transactions.

KPMG’s intelligent tools → bring:
* methodologies for implementation,
* checklists for regulatory compliance,
* automation tools,
* risk management insights,
* audit-friendly processes.

→ **Your SaaS combines BOTH:**

✅ MFRS = **the “what”** (rules)
✅ KPMG intelligence = **the “how”** (best practices + tools)

**Together, in a SaaS platform:**
* you embed MFRS-compliant accounting logic (e.g. revenue recognition, leases, financial instruments)
* you layer on KPMG-inspired intelligence:
  * compliance checks
  * audit trails
  * automated disclosures
  * risk scoring
  * analytics

This gives users:
✅ compliance certainty
✅ operational efficiency
✅ audit readiness
✅ competitive edge
