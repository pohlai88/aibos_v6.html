# üß≠ AIBOS Foundation Document

## üåü Vision

- **One platform for all business operations.**
- **Minimal, intuitive, and secure.**
- **Customizable, modular, and compliant.**
- **Internal-first, ready for external SaaS.**

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Stack (with Rigid Rationale)

- **Universal Stack**: HTML + Vanilla JS + TypeScript + Tailwind + Vite + Supabase.
  - **Rationale**: Universally understood, minimizes onboarding and tech debt, maximizes maintainability and clarity.
- **No custom backend frameworks** unless a need is justified for all entities and approved by steering committee.
  - **Rationale**: Prevents fragmentation, ensures security and auditability.

## üîë Core/Module Boundaries

- **Core (`/src/core/`)**: Handles authentication, user/entity/region context, permissions, audit logs, navigation.
  - *Cannot be modified except by core maintainers.*
- **Modules (`/src/modules/`)**: Each domain (CRM, Accounting, HR, etc.) is an independent, pluggable folder.
  - *Modules must never alter or bypass core logic.*
  - *Modules are enabled/disabled per entity via configuration.*

## üõ°Ô∏è Security, Compliance & Governance

### Data Privacy & Compliance

- **Data locality**: Data is stored and processed in accordance with regional laws (GDPR, CCPA, PIPL, etc.).
- **Entity/region data boundaries**: All access is scoped, with RLS enforced at the DB level.
- **Auditability**: All significant actions are logged, traceable, and monitored.

### Disaster Recovery & Backups

- **Automated backups**: Daily (minimum), with monthly retention for 1 year.
- **Restore procedures**: Documented and tested quarterly.
- **Incident response**: Defined in [Checklist/Task Master](#checklist--task-master).

### Access Control

- **Granular permissions**: User, entity, region, and module-level roles.
- **Onboarding/offboarding**: Process for users, modules, and entities is documented and enforced.

### Change Management

- **Versioning**: All modules and core have version numbers.
- **Changelog**: Maintained for all major changes.
- **Review**: All code is reviewed by at least one core maintainer and validated by AI tools.

### Customization Boundaries

- **Global vs. local config**: IFRS/GAAP logic, security, and audit are global. Workflows, UI, and language can be localized.
- **No module may store sensitive data or manage permissions directly.**

### Testing & Quality

- **Automated tests**: Required for all modules.
- **CI/CD**: All PRs must pass automated checks.
- **Manual review**: Required for all changes to `/core/`.

### Documentation

- **Each module must have its own README.**
- **Business logic and workflows must be documented for end-users and engineers.**

- **Architecture Decisions**: Consult AI for best practices
- **Debugging**: Use AI chat for problem-solving
- **Code Refactoring**: AI-assisted code improvement

### GitHub Copilot Integration
- **Code Review**: Secondary validation of AI-generated code
- **Security Checks**: Identify potential vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Optimization suggestions
- **Best Practices**: Ensure code quality standards

### .cursorrules Configuration
```
You are an expert in TypeScript, HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Vite, and Supabase.

Code Style:
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Use modern ES6+ features
- Follow semantic HTML5 standards
- Use Tailwind utility classes
- Implement proper error handling

SaaS-Specific Rules:
- Always implement authentication checks
- Include subscription/plan validations
- Use Supabase RLS for security
- Implement proper loading states
- Include error boundaries
- Use TypeScript for API responses
- Follow RESTful API conventions
```

## üìä Core SaaS Components

### Authentication System
```typescript
// Supabase Auth integration
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  subscription_tier: 'free' | 'pro' | 'enterprise';
  created_at: string;
  last_sign_in: string;
}
```
